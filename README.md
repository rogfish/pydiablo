# pydiablo
pydiablo is a Diablo 2 toolkit written in Python. The original goal was to calculate and simulate the time required to kill specific monsters using different builds and equipement. The library is still in early stages. It currently has an accurate monster stats parser and the beginnings of a weapon speed calculator.
